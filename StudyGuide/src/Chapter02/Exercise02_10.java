 * (Science: calculating energy)
 * Write a program that calculates the energy 
 * needed to heat water from an initial temperature 
 * to a final temperature. Your program should prompt 
 * the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms 
 * and the initial and final temperatures of the water. 
 * The formula to compute the energy is:
 * Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 * where M is the weight of water in kilograms, 
 * temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is 
 * measured in joules.
