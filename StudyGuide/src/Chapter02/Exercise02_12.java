/*
 * (Physics: finding runway length)
 * Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a 
 * and take-off speed v, you can 
 * compute the minimum runway length 
 * needed for an airplane to take off 
 * using the following formula:
 * length = v^2 / 2a
 * Write a program that prompts the 
 * user to enter v in meters/second 
 * (m/s) and the acceleration a in 
 * meters/second squared (m/s2), and 
 * displays the minimum run- way length.
